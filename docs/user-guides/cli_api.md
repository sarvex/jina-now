# How to use Jina NOW's CLI and API

## Use CLI Parameters

Instead of answering the questions in the CLI dialog manually, you can also provide command-line arguments when starting Jina NOW as shown here.

```bash
jina now start --dataset-type "DocumentArray name" --dataset-name "my-documentarray-id" --index-fields "title" [...]
```
  
## Use the Jina Client

When you have successfully deployed your application, you can send requests to the deployment using the Jina client. To do this,
use the `gateway` that you received upon deploying your app. It will look similar to this:

### Check Liveness

To see whether your application is available and running, simply send a request on the `/ping` endpoint using the gateway
provided to you upon deployment of the app.

```python
from jina import Client
client = Client(
    host='grpcs://now-example-bird-species.dev.jina.ai&data=bird-species' # add your own gateway here
)
response = client.post(on='/ping')
assert response.status_code == 200 # successful response!
```

### Search requests

To make a search request using the Jina client, we need to formulate our query as a `docarray.Document`. Below
is an example of such a document.

```python
from docarray import Document, dataclass
from docarray.typing import Text, Image
from jina import Client

# formulating a multimodal query
@dataclass
class Query:
    text: Text
    image: Image

query_doc = Document(Query(text='cat', image='<example-image-uri>.png'))

client = Client(
    host='grpcs://now-example-bird-species.dev.jina.ai&data=bird-species' # add your own gateway here
)
response = client.search(
        query_doc,
        parameters={'limit': 9, 'filters': {}},
)
assert len(response) == 9
```

Similarly, you can access the other endpoints such as `/suggestion` and `/list`.

## Use the API

If you prefer making post requests directly to the API, you can take a look at the documentation
link supplied to you when deploying your application:

Requests should be made to 'https://nowrun.jina.ai/api/v1/search-app/', which hosts the backend for frontend (BFF),
exposing all important endpoint that you can integrate into your frontend.

Below we will cover some example requests to the endpoints.

### Search requests

Search requests can be formulated as follows:

```bash
curl -X "POST" \
  "https://nowrun.jina.ai/api/v1/search-app/search" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
  'host': 'grpcs://v-nowapi-e0b9387fa1.wolf.jina.ai',
  'port': '443',
  'query': [
              {'name': 'query_text', 'value': 'black dress', 'modality': 'text'},
              {'name': 'query_image', 'value': '<insert_image_uri>', 'modality': 'image'},
           ],
  'limit': '5',
  'filters': {},
  'get_score_breakdown': true,
}"
```

Make sure to grab the `host` from the CLI deployment print as shown in the previous section.
As for the `query`, the BFF allows you to send multimodal queries in the form of a list, where each item in the list
consists of a dictionary in the following form:

```python
{
    'name': 'query_text', # defining the name of your query field
    'value': 'cute cat', # the query itself, consisting of text of image
    'modality': 'text', # the modality of the query, options: 'image' OR 'text'
}
```

Optional parameters:

  - **limit**: set the number of results in the response
    - example: `5`
  - **filters**: a dictionary of filters, with filter name as key and target as value
    - example: `{'tags__color': {'$eq': 'blue'}, 'tags__price': {'$gt': 100}}`
  - **score_calculation**: list of score calculation components defining how fields should be compared and weighted. Each score calculation
        must contain 4 items, the query field and index field, the encoding model used to create representations
        for both fields, and the weight this score should have in the overall calculation, ranging between 0 and 1.
        You can also add a bm25 score, replacing the encoding model with the string `'bm25'` as shown in the example.
    - example: `[['query_text', 'title', 'encodersbert', 1.0], ['query_text', 'description', 'bm25', 0.5]]`
  - **get_score_breakdown**: boolean indicating whether to return the score breakdown for each result document. Scores 
        are returned as a dictionary with the key being the name of the score 
        (example: `'query_text-title-encodersbert-1.0'`) and the value being a `docarray.score.NamedScore`.
    - example: `true`

## Cleanup

```bash
jina now stop
```

## Requirements

- `Linux` or `Mac`
- `Python 3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9` or `3.10`
